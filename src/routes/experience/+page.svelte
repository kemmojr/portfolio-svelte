					BISCIT specialists in Epicor ERP. I worked on developing products that seamlessly
					integrate with Epicor to extend its functionality.

					Two of the products that I have worked on are: RMS - a rental management system, and EKW -
					A warehousing app for handheld scanners to integrate with Epicor Kinetic.üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

						RMS allows for the extension of trackable depreciating assets whilst utilising custom
						Epicor tooling. The APIs store the entirety of its database within the customers own
						Epicor instance. I helped implement a new database solution by migrating from a previous
						MS SQL database. During this, I learned Angular and improved my frontend skills.

						More recently I have spent my time working with the team behind EKW, BISCIT's flagship
						product working with a mature development pipeline optimised for stability. Working in
						this team has sharpened my knowledge of Angular and allowed me to gain a deeper
						understanding of Epicor's inner workings.

					Collaboration and teamwork was key in to this role, with regular meetings and following
					agile processes communication with key stakeholders was essential in making sure problems
					were solved in the optimal way. üíº

					GTICK are a small and lean software house that deliver custom solutions to clients in

					unnecessary processes, rather just favor delivering for the customer.üöÄ

						I got my hands dirty with a wide range of projects and technologies, from developing for

					I worked on a range of projects at GTICK, my biggest achievement was the uplift of a
					legacy application that was used internally for business management. I uplifted the design
					technically and implemented a simple solution using database design to allow for custom
					web markup to be generated.
